# What is brainfree?

I was looking for a project that would allow me to familiarize myself with the technologies listed and expand my knowledge. It was also important to me that it should have a real function for me. And since cloud is on everyone's lips, my application must also run in the cloud later on.

Now it occurred to me that I want to create a place in my head. I need a place where I can store my shopping lists, to-do's, etc. A cashbook should be created from the shopping cards. It should be possible later, if one wants to include family, friends, neighbors, to do the shopping for others with or let do.

To the brainfree later a suggestion should be able to be made, with which supermarket the purchase is most worthwhile.

My current focus is on shopping lists. So the creation, editing, deletion etc. of shopping lists.

As soon as this step is reached, a drag-and-drop function shall be implemented. This is to be used to generate his shopping list according to his favorite recipes.

More on this later...

# Why did I choose this technology stack?

Java and Spring are a lot of fun for me and I find Java very versatile. Angular is the first web framework I came in contact with. In the beginning, I found it hard to learn. In the meantime I changed my mind and now I know the advantages of creating a nice user interface.

I got to know Keycloak through my last employer. And since I wanted to know how Keycloak works, I included it in my project from the very beginning.

If you have any criticism or suggestions, or even if you find a bug, I would be happy to hear from you.
